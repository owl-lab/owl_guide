OCaml Scientific Computing
=================================================

Owl is a dedicated system for scientific and engineering computing. It is designed in the functional programming language OCaml. The project is led by `Liang Wang <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/>`_. The source code is `{licensed under MIT} <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/LICENSE.md>`_ and hosted on the `{Github Repository} <https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl>`_.

* `Owl Tutorial Book <https://ocaml.xyz/book/>`_ (working in progress)
* `Packages Reference <package/index.html>`_


Funding
-------------------------------------------------

We are actively seeking funding opportunities to support our research and development. Financial support can help us focus on building the most powerful system for modern scientific computing.

- For institutional funding, please `contact me <mailto:liang@ocaml.xyz>`_ directly.
- For individuals, please use this `Paypal donation link <https://www.paypal.me/ocaml>`_.



Mission
-------------------------------------------------

Our mission is to push the frontier of high-performance scientific computing, and impact how we develop future analytical applications by building a robust numerical system in the functional programming language. The system aims to serve as the de-facto tool for computation intensive tasks in OCaml.

Owl should fully implement advanced numerical methods, with inherent support for parallel and distributed computing, as well as a complete set of tooling from designing, prototyping, and deploying modern numerical applications. The project provides both researchers and industry programmers a powerful framework to write concise, fast and safe analytical code.

The project should also produce comprehensive learning materials to promote OCaml learning. We hope the project can help more people in learning OCaml by offering them a "numerical path" to the functional programming world.
